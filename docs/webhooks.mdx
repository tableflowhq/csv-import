title: Webhooks
---

<Info>Feature available in <a href="https://tableflow.com/pricing" target="_blank">TableFlow Cloud</a>.</Info>

TableFlow uses webhooks to push real-time notifications for your data imports. For example, you can use webhooks on TableFlow to get notified when a user completes a file import:

1. Your user imports a CSV or Excel file using the embedded TableFlow importer on your web app
2. TableFlow notifies your system, via a webhook, that a data import has been completed
3. The webhook will contain the row data, column definitions, and other information about the import

<Info>The number of rows included is limited to 10,000 or 300 KB of data. If either of these limits are exceeded, an `error` will be set and the data should be retrieved using the [API](/api-reference/get-import-rows).</Info>

## Configure your application to receive webhooks

To get started, create an endpoint where you can receive webhooks. For this example, we’ll use [Svix Play](https://play.svix.com/) to easily set up a test endpoint.

#### 1. Create an endpoint
Go to [play.svix.com](https://play.svix.com/) and copy the provided URL that will receive webhooks. You can also provide your own endpoint URL instead.

#### 2. Add the endpoint to TableFlow
Navigate to your [workspace settings](https://app.tableflow.com/settings) in TableFlow cloud. Under the “Webhooks” section, there is where we’ll add the endpoint we just created and choose the `import.completed event` to be notified when users complete a file import:

#### 3. Send a test event
Send a test event to your webhook by navigating to the “Testing” tab, selected the event to send, and pressing “Send Example”:

You’ll be able to see the webhook received on [Svix Play](https://play.svix.com/), and under the “Logs” tab of the webhooks settings:

</Frame>

After configuring your application to receive webhooks, all subscribed events will be sent to the endpoint. You can now import a file to test out your new webhook!

## Transforming and filtering webhooks

You can use the transformations feature to modify the payload of webhooks or cancel it entirely based on data in the payload.

To add a transformation, select "Enable" and "Edit transformation" under the "Advanced" tab of an endpoint:

#### Transform

You can use transformations to modify the payload to be in the format you need, or add additional parameters.

```javascript
function handler(webhook) {
  webhook.payload.myExtraProperty = 'Foo';
  return webhook;
}
```

#### Filter

To filter webhooks from being sent to an endpoint, you just need to set `webhook.cancel = true`. In this example we filter webhooks to an endpoint based on the import `metadata` (a parameter you can provide the [SDK](/sdk/react#properties)):

<Frame>
![Transformations](/assets/webhooks-transformations-filter.jpg)
</Frame>

```javascript
function handler(webhook) {
  if (webhook.payload.metadata?.environment !== 'development') {
    webhook.cancel = true;
  }
  return webhook;
}
```
